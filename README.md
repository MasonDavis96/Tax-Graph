# Tax-Graph
A utility tool made for residents of the local county to see a visual representation of their Real Market Value, Maximum Assessed Value and Assessed Value For their property.

Django was used to create a web based front-end to retrieve input from the user (account ID). When this is gathered, the python grabs the information and uses it to query the database to retrieve all of the relevant info that will be graphed for the user.

Once the data is retrieved, matplotlib is used to graph the data and lay it out in a visually distinctive way so the users can easily and quickly understand the information that is being plotted. Along with the graph is a table of the numbers to provide 2 seperate ways for the users to look at their information.
